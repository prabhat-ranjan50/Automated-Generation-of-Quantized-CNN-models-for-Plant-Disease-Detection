This project proposes a comprehensive solution that  integrates Autokeras-based model generation, training, quantization, and a  working phase for effective plant disease identification

The growing demand for efficient and automated plant disease detection systems 
has prompted the development of advanced methodologies leveraging machine 
learning techniques. This project proposes a comprehensive solution that 
integrates Autokeras-based model generation, training, quantization, and a 
working phase for effective plant disease identification. The dataset utilized is 
derived from the 'Plant Village Dataset,' containing approximately 87,000 RGB 
images categorized into 38 different classes of healthy and diseased crop leaves. 
The proposed methodology begins with the automated Model Generation phase, 
wherein Autokeras streamlines the process of CNN model creation, selection, and 
hyper parameter tuning. The training phase involves feeding plant images into the 
auto-generated CNN model for feature extraction, utilizing the folder names as 
labels. Subsequently, quantization is introduced as a technique to reduce memory 
and computational requirements, optimizing the model for resource-constrained 
environments. 

In the Working Phase, the quantized CNN model classifies input images, 
providing real-time insights into the health condition of plants. The methodology 
is designed to be deployable in diverse agricultural settings, offering efficient and 
accurate plant disease detection capabilities. The integration of Autokeras and 
quantization techniques ensures automation, efficiency, and reduced model 
complexity. 

This project's iterative and holistic approach allows for continuous improvement, 
incorporating user feedback, collaboration with domain experts, and exploration 
of advanced techniques. The proposed methodology contributes to the 
advancement of agriculture and crop management, providing a scalable and 
accessible solution for plant disease detection.
